## What is pair programming? 

The method known as pair programming is used mainly in agile software development and, more specifically, in extreme programming (XP). 
The programming pair specifies that there are always two people working on code at the same time and that they sit together as much as possible. One is in charge of writing the code and the other of monitoring in real time. At the same time, they are constantly exchanging impressions: they discuss problems, find solutions and develop creative ideas.

These two workers are typically assigned different roles: the programmer who has been assigned the pilot role writes the code. The programmer who has been assigned the copilot role is responsible for monitoring that code. One of the rules of pair programming states that these two roles are exchanged regularly (at short intervals). In this way, a possible hierarchical gap is avoided: equality between both workers is promoted and a fluid exchange of roles is achieved.

## Good practices in pair programming
 
In practice, this is usually a collaboration between two developers with different degrees of experience: thus, a more experienced worker can pass on their knowledge to their younger colleagues directly through practice. On the other hand, it is possible that a younger worker comes up with other ideas, perhaps more innovative, that they can contribute to the project.

Likewise, a mix of workers from different industries can also be quite beneficial: if an old-school programmer collaborates with a designer, the combination of their experiences can be quite helpful for both.

## Advantages and disadvantages of pair programming

Working as a couple within the framework of a project, whether it involves scheduling or another procedure, carries with it many advantages. In general, four eyes see much more than just two - the pair programming method minimizes the risk of errors. While one person writes the code, the other visualizes it and concentrates only on finding errors. In general, it is quite difficult for us to detect the errors themselves. It is usually our colleagues who detect them most quickly.

Another of the great advantages derived from communication is the constant development of creativity: the constant exchange that takes place between the pair of programmers causes ideas that might not be had if the work were individual. Intercom also ensures that problems can be better solved in less time.

However, this is all very time consuming: two programmers work together much faster than one alone, but no more than two programmers working separately. This means that this method makes projects progress more slowly or requires more staff, which in turn increases costs.

Another possible downside is that pair programming is suitable for team building, but only if both partners work well together. Being such a close collaboration, it is possible that the problems they may have between them slow down the results or end up escalating to something much worse.
