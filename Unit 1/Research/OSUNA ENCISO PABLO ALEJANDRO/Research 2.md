## Descriptive statistics

Pearson's correlation coefficient is a type of coefficient used in descriptive statistics. Specifically, it is used in descriptive statistics applied to the study of two variables.

## Pearson's correlation coefficient: what is it for?

Pearson's correlation coefficient is used to study the relationship (or correlation) between two quantitative random variables (minimum interval scale); for example, the relationship between weight and height.

It is a measure that gives us information about the intensity and direction of the relationship. In other words, it is an index that measures the degree of covariation between different linearly related variables.

We must be clear about the difference between relationship, correlation or covariation between two variables (= joint variation) and causality (also called forecast, prediction or regression), since they are different concepts.

## How is it interpreted?

Pearson's correlation coefficient comprises values ​​between -1 and +1. Thus, depending on its value, it will have one meaning or another.

If the Pearson correlation coefficient is equal to 1 or -1, we can consider that the correlation that exists between the variables studied is perfect.

If the coefficient is greater than 0, the correlation is positive (“More, more, and less less). On the other hand, if it is less than 0 (negative), the correlation is negative (“A more, less, and a less, more). Finally, if the coefficient is equal to 0, we can only say that there is no linear relationship between the variables, but there may be some other type of relationship.
