## Pearson's correlation coefficient

#### What is pearson's correlation coefficient?

Pearson's correlation coefficient is a test that measures the statistical relationship between two continuous variables. If the association between the elements is not linear, then the coefficient is not adequately represented.

The correlation coefficient can take a range of values ​​from +1 to -1. A value of 0 indicates that there is no association between the two variables. A value greater than 0 indicates a positive association. That is, as the value of one variable increases, so does the value of the other. A value less than 0 indicates a negative association; that is, as the value of one variable increases, the value of the other decreases.

#### Conditions to carry it out

To carry out the Pearson correlation it is necessary to fulfill the following:

The measurement scale must be an interval or ratio scale.

The variables must be roughly distributed.

The association must be linear.

There should be no outliers in the data.



Pearson's correlation coefficient is the standardized covariance, and its equation differs depending on whether it is applied to a sample, sample Pearson coefficient (r), or if the population population Pearson's coefficient (ρ) is applied.

#### Features

It takes values ​​between [-1, +1], with +1 being a perfect positive linear correlation and -1 being a perfect negative linear correlation.

It is an independent measure of the scales in which the variables are measured.

It does not vary if transformations are applied to the variables.

It does not take into account that the variables are dependent or independent.

Pearson's correlation coefficient is not equal to the slope of the regression line.

It is sensitive to outliers, so it is recommended, if it can be justified, to exclude them from the analysis.

#### Interpretation

In addition to the value obtained for the coefficient, it is necessary to calculate its significance. Only if the p-value is significant can it be accepted that there is a correlation and this will be of the magnitude indicated by the coefficient. No matter how close the value of the correlation coefficient is to +1 or -1, if it is not significant, it must be interpreted that the correlation of both variables is 0 since the observed value may be due to chance. (See later how to calculate significance).
